If you dont feel like computing the table on your own, you can use this generic method. It is
a simple approximation which may be not as accurate as a good table computed from the reference
values in the datasheet. You can increase precision if you use a temperature/resistance for
R0/T0, which is near your operating temperature. This will reduce precision for lower temperatures,
which are not realy important. The resistors must fit the following schematic:
@code
VREF ---- R2 ---+--- Termistor ---+-- GND
                |                 |
                +------ R1 -------+

@endcode

- 250000 : Fastes with errorrate of 0% with 16 or 32 MHz - update wiring_serial.c in your board files. See boards/readme.txt

- 76800 : Best setting for Arduino with 16 MHz, Error rate 0,2% page 198 AVR1284 Manual. Result: Faster communication then 115200
- 57600 : Should produce nearly no errors, on my gen 6 it's faster than 115200 because there are no errors slowing down the connection
