For easy configuration, the default settings enable parameter storage in EEPROM.
This means, after the first upload many variables can only be changed using the special
M commands as described in the documentation. Changing these value sin the configuration.h
has no effect. Parameters overriden by EEPROM settings are calibartion values, extruder 
values except thermistor tables and some other parameter likely to change during usage
like advance steps or ops mode.
To override EEPROM settings with config settings, set EEPROM_MODE 0

http://hydraraptor.blogspot.com/2007/10/measuring-temperature-easy-way.html

If you have a sprinter temperature table, you have to multiply the first value with 4 and the second with 8.
This firmware works with increased precision, so the value reads go from 0 to 4095 and the temperature is

If you dont feel like computing the table on your own, you can use this generic method. It is
a simple approximation which may be not as accurate as a good table computed from the reference
values in the datasheet. You can increase precision if you use a temperature/resistance for
R0/T0, which is near your operating temperature. This will reduce precision for lower temperatures,
which are not realy important. The resistors must fit the following schematic:
@code
VREF ---- R2 ---+--- Termistor ---+-- GND
                |                 |
                +------ R1 -------+
                |                 |
                +---- Capacitor --+
                |
                V measured
@endcode                
                
If you don't have R1, set it to 0.
The capacitor is for reducing noise from long thermistor cable. If you don't have have one, it's OK.

If you don't need the generic table, uncomment the following define.
