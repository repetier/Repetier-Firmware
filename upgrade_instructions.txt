If you are upgrading from an earlier version, make sure you followed the upgrade
instructions for that version.

Upgrade to 0.91

Starting with 0.91 we offer an online configuration tool. You find it here:

http://www.repetier.com/firmware/v091/

Once you have created a configuration with that tool, you can upload these
configurations to the latest version and it will add all missing options and
highlight them for inspections. Unfortuanetly this relies on a special comment
conteining configuration data, so uploading existing Configuration.h files
will not work.


Upgrade to 0.80

The EEPROM storage uses now a checksum to help switching from other firmwares. This
will cause your eeprom to get overwritten with the first upload, so save you old values.

The configuration has also made significant changes. Copy your values into the new
Configuration.h file. Watch out for speeds - they are now all mm/sec!
Also watch out for the PID values. They are now floating point and don't include
multiplier values. Best is to do a M303 for autodetect new values.


Upgrade to 0.70

The configurations files Configuration.h and uiconfig.h have undergone larger
modifications. The best is to use the new config files and copy your values into them.
If you don't use the printer user interface you don't need to modify uiconfig.h

The new firmware stores one more parameter into EEPROM. This place is not initalized
with a useful value, so you must explicitly overwrite it if you are using EEPROM. The
easiest way is to send the following code after the first upload:

M206 T3 X0 P196

The advance algorithm changed. Now the new linear term Advance-L is preferred and the
quadratic term is now disabled by default. If you still want to use the quadratic term
add a

#define ENABLE_QUADRATIC_ADVANCE 

to the configuration.
