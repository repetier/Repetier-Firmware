Capabilities detection
----------------------

While it is nice if a firmware supports some special features, it would be
even better if hosts would detect that these are available so they
start using them. Especially with the wild growth of firmware forks and
versions, no host can know which variant can handle what. So at least
for Repetier-Firmware we introduce with version 1.0 a new simple protocol
to tell hosts what features are available, so they can activate them.

To make it easy to detect, a standard M115 report gets now extended by
one or more lines, each line telling what capability. These lines have the
following format:
Cap:<NameOfCapability>:<0 or 1>

Notice: no spaces allowed, Name is upper case with underline to separate words.
Lines MUST start with "Cap:" so it can be parsed very quickly by hosts.

The last value indicates if that capability is supported or not. The simple
absence of a message is not enough since it would be possible, that the
firmware simply does not report capabilities at all and host has to make
assumptions like showing eeprom editor even with the risk that it is not
available. Whereas a 0 value shows that a function is known, but the
functionality is not implemented/active.

Knowing different developers will add other capabilities is no real problem
as long as all names differ, so hosts can distinguish them by name. Hosts
not understanding a name simply ignore them.

Currently defined capabilities:

Cap:EEPROM

Defines if firmware is compiled with eeprom support.

Cap:AUTOREPORT_TEMP

Defines if firmware can automatically report temperatures. This feature
needs to be enabled by M155 S1 so older hosts do not get double responses
from own M105 requests and auto report feature.

Cap:PROGRESS

Firmware supports the progress protocol:
- M530 S<printing> L<layer> - Enables explicit printing mode (S1) or disables it (S0). L can set layer count
- M531 filename - Define filename being printed
- M532 X<percent> L<curLayer> - update current print state progress (X=0..100) and layer L

This allows a host to enable a special information mode on LCD display, so that
users see progress in percent, model being printed and layer being printer and
total layer. Hosts can also use M117 to send time remaining to status line.

This feature should onely be enabled if a lcd is available to show it, otherwise
the extra commands are useless.

Cap:AUTOLEVEL

Firmware supports autoleveling.

Cap:Z_PROBE

Firmware supports z probing.

Cap:SOFTWARE_POWER

Supports enabling/disabling power with M80/M81

Cap:TOGGLE_LIGHTS

Supports toggling lights on/off with M355.

Cap:PAUSESTOP

Supports bidirectional pause/stop handling. What this means is that this
system allows it to pause a print controlled by a host from firmware and
from host. It even allows to pause on printer and continue on host and
vice versa.

From the firmware side this is achieved by sending
RequestPause:
to request host to start pausing and
RequestContinue:
to ask hosts to continue printing. The real action is done by the host in any case.
To stop the print from firmware it would send
RequestStop:

For the host side the M539 command is used.
M539 S1 ; enable pause protocol so firmware knows it is supported by host
M539 P0 ; Host did continue
M539 P1 ; Host entered pause state

Cap:PREHEAT

Supports storage and retrieval of preheat temperatures. Also allows setting
preheat temperatures instead of individual temperature. Therefore the M codes
104,140,109 and 190 have to additional parameter:
H1 - Set to preheat temperature. Not effective if gcode also contains S param.
O<offset> - Add offset to temperature. Especially usefull with preheat temperature as base.

M170 - Set or retrieve preheat temperatures
Parameter:
  B<bedPreheat> : Sets bed preheat temperature
  C<chamberPreheat> : Sets heated chamber temperature
  T<extruder> S<preheatTemp> : Sets preheat temperature for given extruder
  L0 : List preheat temperatures. Returns
  PREHEAT_BED:temp PREHEAT0:extr0 PREHEAT1:extr1 PREHEAT_CHAMBER:temp
