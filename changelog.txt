Version 0.51 03-03-2012
  Individual endstop inverting for all with different entstop types.
  SD support with Arduino 1.0 now works.

Version 0.50 25-02-2012
  Changed implementation of Power ON/OFF.
  Added #define ENABLE_POWER_ON_STARTUP to config, so Gen7 boards are powered
  up on start. No more need to send M80 after startup.

Version 0.49 21-02-2012
  SD upload in ascii mode now works.
  SD print now prints also the last command.
  Added extruder power in output for M105
  
Version 0.48 15-02-2012
  Disabled wait at temperature change. Caused pauses with skeinforge temp. change
  
Version 0.47b 13-02-2012
  Added software PWM for fan.
  Updated software PWM for heater.  
  
Version 0.46
  DISABLE_(XYZ) now works on a move basis as expected, not on a job basis.
  Only Repetier.pde was changed.

Version 0.45 28-01-2012
  Fan settings don't wait for moves to finish any more. This could cause a longer
  stop making blobs possible.
  M109 now takes direction of temp. change in account and allows a target
  temperature range (TEMP_HYSTERESIS)
  
Version 0.44 24-01-2012
  Added M112 command (Emergency kill)
  G4 dwell now waits until move queue is empty before dwelling
  G84 stops extruder motor
  configuration.h from version 0.40 works

Version 0.43 31-12-2011
  Added support for PTC thermistors
  
Version 0.42 28.12.2011
  Added hardware PWM PID control for Gen 7 boards
  Easier config if you have a heated bed.
  configuration.h from version 0.40 works
  
Version 0.41 20.12.2011
  Fixed everything for compilation with Arduino 1.0 IDE
  Added software PWM, so now Sanguino boards can use PID control.
  Fixed Issue 4 - Wrong output monitoring if heated bed is present.
  Added pin configuration for gen7 (thanks bryanandaimee)
  No changes is configuration.h from version 0.40

Version 0.40 30.11.2011
  Interrupt based temperature control.
  Higher precision temp. tables.
  Fixed bug causing reset under some conditions.

Version 0.39 5.11.2011
  Now recovers from communication errors send in ASCII mode. 
  SD card commands now fully tested and functional
  No extruder interrupt if advance and ops support are disabled. 

Version 0.38 30.10.2011
  Fixed errors with high frequency (thanks Theodleif)
  
Version 0.37 26.10.2011
  Added individual check interval for heated bed.
  Better comments in configuration for heated bed.
  
Version 0.36 24.10.2011
  Fixed compilation error with EEPROM_MODE 0.
  Fixed compilation error for heated bed configs.
  6 software endstops instead of 2 groups. 

Version 0.35 3.10.2011
  Changed aceleration/deceleration computation.
  Moved extruder handling in its own interrupt routine.
  Added an ooze prevention system.
  Fixed path planning algorithm.
  Path planning now works from the first line on.
  Changed advance debug M230 command to M232
  
Version 0.33  26.9.2011
  Added configuration option SCALE_PID_TO_MAX 

Version 0.32 24.9.2011
  Improved speed in stepper interrupt.
  Added trajectory smoothing.
  Added pressure control (advance algorithm from Matthew Roberts).
  Added path planning algorithm for better printing speed.
  Using fastio instead of slow digitalWrite/Read where possible
  Included faster wiring_serial.c
  Removed some bugs.

Version 0.31 10.9.2011
  Added userdefines thermistortable in configuration
  Added generic thermistortable defined by r0,t0,beta,r1,r2

Version 0.3a 9.9.2011
  Fixed compile error with RAMPS/MEGA boards
