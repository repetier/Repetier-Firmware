V 0.91.48 (2014-11-24)
- Adding of M3105, which allows to specify the movement after pause in [mm].
  - M3102 remains available and allows to specify the movement after pause in [steps].
- After the heat bed scan the heating bed is moved down a little bit in order to avoid accidental collisions with the extruder during the next homing.
- In case the hardware button "Pause" was pressed during the homing of the printer, the firmware could end up in a hang.
- All heaters are turned off after the heat bed scan automatically.
- In case the current movement after pause is bigger than the remaining distance in x/y/z direction, the printer moves until the min/max position.
  - Before this version, no movement into the according direction was performed in such a case.
- Cleanup of the delays for the external EEPROM.
- The calculation of the z-compensation has been moved from the previously used interrupt routine to the main loop.
- The homing-order at the beginning of the heat bed scan has been changed to the standard homing order.
- The automatic object output now can be configured via the OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT script.
  - M3104 has been removed because all of its functionality is replaced through the OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT script now.
- Adding of FEATURE_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_POSITIONS.
  - In case this #define is not 1, the "Position X/Y/Z" menu allows to move into the x/y/z direction only when the homing position is known.
- In case the "Position X/Y/Z" menu is used in order to change the position manually, the displayed position does not change anymore when the printer has reached its minimal/maximal position.
- There was a chance that the temperature management was disabled while the firmware waited for the continue/pause position. As a result, the real temperatures could go above or drop below the desired temperatures.
- There was a chance that the x/y/z steppers were moved while the "Output Filament" or "Input Filament" operations were in progress.
- Increasing of the access delay for the external EEPROM.
  - At some printers the previous delay was too short and as a result the z-compensation values could not be read/written properly.
- Adding of the "Load Filament" menu entry to the "Quick Settings" menu.
  - This operation can be used in order to load new filament to the extruder.
  - MOUNT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT can be used in order to define the exact command sequence for the load of the filament.
- Adding of the "Unload Filament" menu entry to the "Quick Settings" menu.
  - This operation can be used in order to output the filament from the extruder.
  - UNMOUNT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT can be used in order to define the exact command sequence for the unload of the filament.
- Fine tunning of various settings within Configuration.h:
  - new PID values for the extruder
  - new motor currents
  - correction of a DRV8711 register for better support of higher feedrates
  - ...
- Adding of RF1000_MICRO_STEPS which allows to switch the to-be-used micro steps between 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64.
  - The default value has been set to 32. This is different to the 8 micro steps which were used so far.
  - Most position variables have been changed from short to long in order to support also the higher number of steps.
- The format of the compensation matrix has been changed so that the same compensation matrix can be used for different micro step settings.
  - There is no need anymore to perform a rescan after the to-be-used micro steps have been changed.
- In case the z-stepper was enabled via the hardware buttons it might not have been disabled ever.
- Redefinition of the hardware buttons for the z-direction:
  - In case printing is in progress, these hardware buttons can be used in order to fine-tune the z-position. There is no automatic increasing of the z-speed in case of this mode.
  - In case there is no printing in progress, these hardware buttons behave like the "Position Z" menu.
  - FEATURE_ENABLE_MANUAL_Z_SAFETY has been enabled in order to avoid an accidental overrun of the z-min endstop.
- There was a chance that not all steppers were disabled properly during the restart/reset of the firmware.
- The case lights were not turned on/off when they were switched via the menu.
  - Removing of ENABLE_OUT1 (this pin is used for the case lights).
- Adding of support for the case fan.
  - The case fan is enabled automatically when the extruder heater is on.
  - Removing of ENABLE_HZ2 (this pin is used for the case fan now).
  - CASE_FAN_ON_TEMPERATURE can be used in order to configure the temperature at which the case fan shall be turned on.
  - CASE_FAN_OFF_DELAY can be used in order to configure the delay after which the case fan shall be turned off.
- Adding of M3120, which allows to turn the case fan on.
- Adding of M3121, which allows to turn the case fan off.
  - In case the S parameter is passed it is used in order to configure the new delay after which the case fan shall be turned off.
- When the SD card is unmounted, the menu item selector is set correctly in front of the "Mount Card" menu item.
- Avoiding of a value overflow which could cause a printing error around a z-height of 51 mm.
- Improvements for the EEPROM_MODE.
- Review of menu texts.

V 0.91.34 (2014-06-06)
- Enabling of the EEPROM_MODE.
- Review of menu texts.
- Disabling of the "Debugging" menu.
  - SHOW_DEBUGGING_MENU can be used in order to toggle this menu between "shown" and "hidden".
- Disabling of the "Configuration" -> "Extruder" menu.
  - SHOW_EXTRUDER_MENU can be used in order to toggle this menu between "shown" and "hidden".
- Increasing of the motor driver currents.
- Switching from UI_MENU_ACTIONCOMMAND_FILTER to UI_MENU_ACTIONCOMMAND for all menu entries which used MENU_MODE_PRINTING.
- The menu entry "Configuration" -> "General" -> "Lights" can be used now in order to turn the lights (Arduino pin 25) on or off.
- Improved scrolling of long menu entries.
- Merging of the changes from the repetier firmware V 0.91.7 from 2014-03-15:
  - Adding of M99.
  - Adding of support for FEATURE_BABYSTEPPING.
    - This feature allows change the z-position via the menu.
  - Adding of support for HEATER_PWM_SPEED.
    - This feature allows to configure the update speed for the heater PWMs.
  - Adding of one retry before a SD card error is detected.
  - Adding of the menu mode MENU_MODE_PRINTING.
  - Improved delta moves.
  - Several minor clean-ups and improvements.
  - Additions for improvded debugging capabilities.
- Calling of "Stop Print" while the printing was paused could hang the firmware.
- In case the printing is aborted because of any reason, also the fan is turned off now.
- In case there is a printing from the SD card going on and a temperature sensor becomes defect, the printing is aborted.
  - This functionality can be turned on and off via the FEATURE_ABORT_PRINT_AFTER_TEMPERATURE_ERROR switch.
  - A printing via the PC is not affected by this functionality and the printer continues to run in dry mode like it did until now already.
- Adding of additional beeper outputs for various changes of the printer state:
  - start/abort/stop printing via the SD card
  - pause/continue printing
  - start/abort/stop heat bed scan
- The beeper can be turned on and off via the menu "Configuration" -> "General" -> "Beeper".
  - BEEPER_MODE from Configuration.h can be used in order to define whether the beeper shall be on or off by default.
  - The beeper mode also can be stored to/restored from the EEPROM.
- Optional emergency z-stop in order to detect a possible collision (extruder against heat bed).
  - This feature can be turned on via FEATURE_EMERGENCY_Z_STOP.
  - This feature can be configured via EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_DIGITS_MIN, EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_DIGITS_MAX, EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_INTERVAL and EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_CHECKS.
- Removing of a possible value overflow in case very big values were assigned to OUTPUT_OFFSET_Z.
- Homing of an axis always sets previousMillisCmd to the current time in order to avoid that all steppers are disabled again directly after the homing.
  - In case of an operation like "Home all" via the menu of the printer, all steppers could become disabled before this change.
  - As a result, "Output Object" could not work (because per definition, it can work only in case the steppers are enabled and there was a homing since the last enabling of the steppers).
- Improved clean-up and output of the object after a stop of the printing from the SD card.
- Moving of the z-axis via the hardware buttons supports acceleration and allows faster speeds now.
- Manual outputting of filament (via the Host software and/or via the hardware button) could cause an unwanted emergency pause.
- When the printing is paused, the extruder current is lowered now.
  - EXTRUDER_CURRENT_PAUSED can be used in order to configure the to-be-used current while the printing is paused.
  - EXTRUDER_CURRENT_PAUSE_DELAY can be used in order to configure after which time interval in status "paused" the extruder current shall be lowered.
- Output object has been changed so that it moves into z-direction first and into x and y direction afterwards.
- The entry "Bed Temp" has been removed from the quick settings.
- In case the printing via the SD card is active, the quick menu provides the "Stop Print" entry now which can be used in order to cancel the print.
- The order of the entries within the quick settings menu has been changed.
- Stopping of the print via the menu now also disables all heaters, outputs the object and disables all steppers.
  - All steppers are disabled also after a manual "Output Object".
- Improved initialization of the display.
- Correcting of the comments about the DRV8711 register settings.
- Adding of averaging to the pressure measurement for the emergency pause.
  - EMERGENCY_PAUSE_INTERVAL can be used in order to configure the interval at which the emergency pause functionality shall determine the current pressure
  - EMERGENCY_PAUSE_CHECKS can be used in order to configure the number of measurements which shall be averaged
- The minimal and maximal allowed pause pressure can be configured separately now.
  - See EMERGENCY_PAUSE_DIGITS_MIN and EMERGENCY_PAUSE_DIGITS_MAX.
- Changing of the configuration of the DRV8711 drivers in order to achieve a more precise stepping.
- Adding of a configurable delay after enabling of the x/y/z/extruder steppers.
  - STEPPER_ON_DELAY can be used in order to configure the to-be-used delay.
- Adding of M3110, which allows to lock the currently shown status text.
- All acceleration values within the "Configuration" -> "Acceleration" menu can be increased by 100 now.
- At the end of the heat bed scan, the status display provides information about whether the scan was successful or whether it had to be aborted.
- The menu option "Set to Origin" has been disabled (via the FEATURE_SET_TO_ORIGIN definition).
- The "Quick Settings" -> "Home All" operation has been disabled during the print.
- "M3070 S2" (= pause print and move away) has been corrected so that the printing can be continued properly again.
