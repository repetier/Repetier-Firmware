V RF.01.38 (2017-12-19)
- Fixing of compiler errors in case FEATURE_MILLING_MODE was set to 0 for the RF1000 variant of the firmware.
- Adding of a timeout so that continuePrint() can not block the further execution of G-Codes forever.
- Improved handling of RF1000 installations where the z-min and z-max endstops are within the same circuit.
- Adding of support for the following device configuration:
  - RF2000 + miller
- Direct steps into the y and z direction could cause small, unwanted steps into the x direction.
  - These small steps could cause the x stepper to buzz.
- The menu items "Set XY Start" and "Set XY End" did not set the start/end position properly in case direct movements where used to move to the start/end position.
- readIdlePressure() cancels the heat bed scan in case the idle pressure is not constant.
- After the start of the heat bed scan, the firmware waits until all temperatures are reached before it starts with the homing.
  - After the homing, the z-axis is moved down HEAT_BED_SCAN_Z_START_STEPS steps (default = 0.5 mm).
- The default homing speeds for the milling mode have been increased by about 50 %.
- The z offset from the menu was not taken over during the startup of the firmware.
- The z offset from the menu was not updated properly after the switch of the operating mode.
- The last column and row of the heat bed/work part scan did not find their way into the heat bed/work part compensation matrix.
  - Improved rounding of the x/y positions within the first row/column of the compensation matrix.
- In case both extruders were heated up before the heat bed scan, only the first extruder was turned off at the end of the scan.
- Adding of support for M3117.
  - This command can be used in order to set a status text which is not overwritten by M117.
  - M3117 makes M3110 obsolete, thus M3110 is not supported anymore.
- In case the Z-compensation is active, "Cmp" is displayed at the status display right to the current z-value.
- Adding of support for an alternative mode for the displayed z-value.
  - In operating mode "print", the menu entry "Configuration" - "General" - "Z Scale" can be used in order to determine whether the displayed z-value shall be counted from z-min or from the surface of the heat bed.
  - In operating mode "mill", the menu entry "Configuration" - "General" - "Z Scale" can be used in order to determine whether the displayed z-value shall be counted from the determined z-origin or from the surface of the work part.
- In case an error or a warning is detected by the firmware, an according error/warning information can be displayed directly at the display.
  - The status information is displayed until it is acknowledged via a button (or until it is overwritten by a following status information).
  - An eventually ongoing print/mill operation is not interrupted/delayed through a displayed status information.
  - Additional information can be provided via the log of the connected PC application (Repetier-Host).
- In case FEATURE_EMERGENCY_Z_STOP is active, the strain gauge values are not examined anymore while the print/mill operation is paused.
  - During this pause, someone might want to clean the extruder or to exchange the used tool of the miller. Such operations can bring high forces onto the strain gauge, in which case an emergency z block was possible.
- In case the z-origin at the beginning of a mill operation was not searched at the x/y start position of the work part scan, the determined z offset could be wrong.
- In case the firmware processes a long-lasting operation, it can notify an attached PC application via "busy:" packets. As a result, the PC application knows that the firmware is still alive and can avoid unnecessary timeouts.
- Adding of support for multiple (up to 9) heat bed z-compensation matrices.
  - Possible use cases are different heat bed z-compensation matrices for different beds and/or different heat bed z-compensation matrices for different filaments/temperatures.
  - The active heat bed z-compensation matrix can be chosen via M3009.
- Adding of support for a more precise heat bed scan.
  - This more precise mode waits longer after heating up of the heating bed and extruders and it determines the static offset in z-direction which is caused by the changing length of the extruder at the printing temperature.
  - The menu entries "Configuration" - "Z Calibration" - "Scan PLA/ABS" perform the scan with predefined temperature profiles for PLA/ABS.
  - M3010 can be called with the S1 (PLA) or S2 (ABS) parameters now in order to start the scan with predefined temperature profiles for PLA/ABS.
- The G-codes M3030, M3031, M3032, M3033, M3040, M3041, M3042, M3050, M3051, M3052, M3053, M3054 and M3055 are available also in operating mode "mill" now.
- G0/G1 commands are allowed to overdrive Z-min now.
  - The overdrive is limited through Z_OVERRIDE_MAX and allows G0/G1 to decrease the height of the first layer even in case Z-min is active already.
  - An example use case can appear in case the calibration line is printed with a bigger height (e.g. 0.35 mm) than the first layer (e.g. 0.1 mm) - in such a scenario, the active z-compensation could drive the heat bed upwards so that Z-min is active already.
- The mode of the movement via the "Position X/Y/Z" menus can be configured now.
  - Within these menus, the right menu button can be pressed in order to switch the mode between "Single Steps", "Single Move", "1 mm", "10 mm" and "50 mm".
  - The mode which is chosen within the "Position Z" menu is applied also to the "Heat Bed up" and "Heat Bed down" hardware buttons.
- The speed of the PWM for the fans has been changed from ~15 to ~122 Hz.
- The maximal length in x direction has been changed to 230 mm for the milling mode.
- M3006 and M3146 support the Z parameter now which allows to configure the static z-offset in [mm].
- M3007 and M3008 support the Z parameter now which allows to configure the z-compensation scope in [mm].
- The codepage of all .cpp and .h files has been changed so that also characters like ° and µ can be used without warnings from the Arduino IDE.
- Improved description of all RF-specific M-codes within RF.h.
- M3013 P1 and M3153 P1 can be used now in order to output the z-offsets from the current z-compensation matrix in [mm] (instead of the default unit [steps]).
- The firmware has sent "Start" via USB instead of "start" after its startup, which could cause problems with applications like OctoPrint.
- Single moves into z-direction via the hardware buttons could continue although the button was released already.
- Some unnecessary blocking of manual movements into the x, y and z-directions has been removed.
- The "Hotend Type" setting from the menu was reset during each restart of the firmware.
- There were situations where the wrong heat bed matrix could be loaded.
- M303 did not update the P-value (only the I- and D-values were written to the EEPROM).
- In case the "Z Type" of the RF1000 was configured to "Circuit", the firmware could detect Z-max as hit instead of Z-min during the processing of the first layers.
- The firmware could hang or reset in case it had to process a lot of G-codes of rather short execution length (e.g. the single linear segments of a circle).
- The emergency stop because of too high pressure values from the strain gauge stops all axes (instead of only the z-axis) now.
- Successive homing of the z-axis and enabling of the z-compensation could lead to a wrong calculation of the z-position.
- Removing of the .gitattributes file in order to allow easier cross-platform collaboration.
- In case the heat bed scan is started and the extruder is warmer than the target temperature, the firmware waits until the extruder has cooled down.
- Review of all calls to the watchdog in order to avoid situations where the heaters could remain constantly on because of a hang of the firmware.
- "Printer Ready" could be shown too early (= at any moment in the middle of the printing). Typically this information was shown only for a short moment of time.
- On some boards the watchdog could fire during the startup of the firmware, in which case the firmware ended in an endless restart loop.
- M116 uses TEMP_TOLERANCE instead of "1" in order to judge whether the target temperature has been reached.
- The PWM speed for the fan of the RF1000 has been changed from 122 Hz to 15 Hz.
  - The PWM speed for the fan of the RF2000 remains unchanged at 122 Hz.
- Directly after the start of the firmware, wrong values could be shown for the current temperatures of the heat bed and of the extruder.
- After a restart of the firmware, the menu of the RF2000 could show that the 230 V plug is on although it is always turned off during the start of the firmware.
- Minor clean-ups.

V RF.01.10 (2015-12-14)
- This firmware can be compiled for the RF1000 and for the RF2000.
  - Switch the value for "MOTHERBOARD" within Configuration.h between "DEVICE_TYPE_RF1000" and "DEVICE_TYPE_RF2000" in order to compile the proper variant of the firmware.
  - In case the wrong firmware is loaded (= the RF1000 firmware at the RF2000 board or the RF2000 firmware at the RF1000 board), the firmware beeps 4 times after the start and does not perform any other tasks.
  - The following device configurations are supported at the moment:
    - RF1000 + single extruder
    - RF1000 + miller
    - RF2000 + dual extruder
- The following modifications apply to both variants of the firmware:
  - The displayed x/y/z positions within the display of the device are the current position (according to the so-far performed steps) now (and not the last calculated position from the queue of commands).
  - The z offset which can be configured via M3006 also can be changed via the menu now.
  - All menu entries have been reviewed.
  - A separate counter for the operating hours in operating mode "mill" has been added.
  - A service interval has been added which can inform about the amount of time which is left until the next service should be performed.
    - In case the print/mill shall be canceled via the menu, an additional question is displayed in order to avoid unintentional abortions.
  - In case the firmware shall be restarted via the menu, an additional question is displayed in order to avoid unintentional restarts.
  - The menu text which requests to turn on the miller could be displayed too short.
  - The currently mounted extruder type can be configured via the menu.
  - The currently mounted miller type can be configured via the menu.
  - The speed of the x/y/z movements during pause and continue operations has been improved.
  - The speed of x/y/z movements which are performed via the hardware buttons and via the menu has been improved.
  - In case "Unload Filament" or "Load Filament" are called via the menu and the extruder is cold at the moment, the extruder is heated up before the requested operation is performed.
  - The minimal and maximal strain gauge digits which trigger the emergency pause can be configured via M3075 Ss Pp now.
  - The status text could show "Heating Extruder" even in case the setpoint temperature after M109 was 0°.
  - The "Position Extruder" menu items could allow to move the cold extruder.
  - The two present "Position Z" menus could show a slightly different behavior when the Z position was close to the z-max endstop.
  - The handling of invalid commands like "U1" has been improved so that the firmware can continue to process further (correct) commands.
  - FEATURE_CASE_LIGHT can be used in order to enable support for the case light in case there is a case light attached via the CASE_LIGHT_PIN.
  - Adding of support for M3060, which outputs the device type and the firmware version.
  - Adding of support for G80 and G81 Xx Yy Rr Zz Ff (= drilling).
  - FEATURE_HEAT_BED_TEMP_COMPENSATION can be used in order to compensate temperature drifts between the temperature sensor of the heating bed and the surface of the heating bed.
  - Adding of M3006, which allows to specify the manual z-offset in [µm].
    - M3004 has been discarded (it allowed to specify the manual z-offset in [steps] previously).
  - EXT0_HOTEND_TYPE can be used now in order to configure which type of hotend is installed.
    - Depending to the chosen type, the default PID parameters are configured.
  - Fixing of a compiler error in case CASE_FAN_PIN was set to -1.
  - The minimal allowed step size for the heat bed/work part scan has been changed from 20 to 10 mm.
    - In case the minimal allowed step size is applied the startup of the firmware can be delayed by a few seconds because the reading of the z-compensation matrix needs more time.
  - The additional moving operations (e.g. for the z-compensation and for the hardware buttons) have been moved from ISR(PWM_TIMER_VECTOR) to ISR(TIMER1_COMPA_vect).
    - The actual calculation of the z-compensation is done with less blocking of interrupts.
    - This modification should eliminate seldom communication errors (and as a result, short stops of the printing process) which could have occurred with previous versions.
  - It was possible to enable the z-compensation multiple times in case M3001 was sent multiple times in a certain order.
    - As a result, the z-compensation value could be applied multiple times because each new enabling of the z-compensation assumed the current z-position to be the not-compensated one.
  - The recalculation of the current z-compensation value has been speeded up from 10 times to 1000 times per second.
    - This improvement reduces the number of z-axis steps which must be performed after each recalculation and as a result the z-axis is moved more smoothly.
  - M3001 does not allow anymore to enable the z-compensation in case the home position of the z-axis is unknown.
  - The z-axis correction now is being applied directly after M3001 has been sent, no matter whether another move into x or y direction has been performed already.
    - As always, the z-axis correction is applied only in case the current z-axis position is bigger than 0.
  - Redefinition of prog_char in order to allow to compile the sources also with Arduino V 1.6.5.
    - This version of Arduino outputs a warning about "Low memory available" available memory, but this warning is misguided and can be ignored.
  - Improved clean-up after the end/abort of a print from the SD card.
    - Previous versions of the firmware might have performed a small additional move into x and/or y-direction after the output of the object.
  - In case the to-be-processed G-code from the SD card contained a non-ASCII character, the interpreter could switch from ASCII to binary - and as a result, it was not able to interpret the following G-code(s) properly.
  - All micro (µ) signs have been replaced through a standard-u in order to avoid problems which occurred at some platforms.
  - Removing of the support for M26, M92 and M251.
  - M30 (delete file) can not be used anymore while the printing/milling from the SD card is in progress.
  - Pausing via the menu of the device now works in the same way as the pausing via the hardware buttons.
  - The z-compensation matrix is not loaded during the startup of the firmware anymore.
    - Instead, the z-compensation matrix is loading before it is needed the first time. This allows a significant faster startup of the firmware.
  - While a heat bed scan, work part scan or the finding of the origin is in progress, the following commands are ignored (except of an according log entry):
    - G0
    - G1
    - G2
    - G3
    - G28
    - G81
  - Sending of these commands could have a serious impact onto the ongoing scan/search because they could interfere with the movements from the scan/search.
  - The ongoing heat bed scan / work part scan can be aborted faster now (e.g. through M3010).
  - Changing of the precision of the xxx_STEPS_PER_MM from long to float.
  - Changing of MIN_EXTRUDER_TEMP from 160 to 120 °C (because a temperature of 120 °C can be used perfectly in order to remove/pull out the filament from the extruder).
  - Adding of the AUTOMATIC_EEPROM_UPDATE, which allows to choose whether the EEPROM shall be updated directly after each change within the menu or only after "Store to EEPROM" has been called.
  - Redefinition of SUPPORT_CURA to ALLOW_EXTENDED_COMMUNICATION.
    - Via this new define, all non-standard communication/messages from the firmware to the USB host can be disabled. Some applications/print servers may require to disable these non-standard messages.
  - Homing is not allowed anymore while the device is doing a (heat bed/work part) scan and while it is searching the z-origin.
    - In addition, a homing in x and y direction is allowed only in case the device knows which Z-endstop is pressed (if any).
  - Additional debug functionality has been added for the analysis of the heat bed scan and for the z-compensation.
  - Calling of runStandardTasks() has been removed from moveZ() because with some G-Codes this call could cause the firmware to hang.
  - Fine tuning of settings within Configuration.h:
    - The default number of microsteps has been changed from 8 to 32.
    - The G-code script for the output of printed objects has been updated.
- The following issues from GitHub have been resolved:
  - #5 (after mounting of the SD card, the default menu item is "Print File"/"Mill File" now)
  - #14 (the offset of the z-axis was not set correctly after the Z-origin has been set)
  - #15, #16 (all pin definitions are within Pins.h now)
- For the RF1000 variant of the firmware, the following additional features have been added:
  - Adding of FEATURE_CNC_MODE.
    - When this #define is set to 2, the RF1000 can be switched between the "print" and the "mill" mode via its menu.
    - In this configuration, the additional z-max endstop can be used. This z-max endstop is connected in a circuit with the z-min endstop.
    - In case the z-max endstop is reached through a manual movement of the z-axis (either via the hardware buttons or via the menu), the z axis moves a short distance upwards automatically in order to free the z-endstop again.
    - The default operating mode can be configured via the DEFAULT_OPERATING_MODE #define.
  - Adding of FEATURE_FIND_Z_ORIGIN.
    - In operating mode "mill", the "Find Z=0" menu item can be used in order move the work bed upwards automatically until the current work part hits the current tool.
    - This position is used in order to set the origin in z-direction (Z=0).
    - FIND_Z_ORIGIN_SCRIPT can be used in order to configure a series of G-codes which is executed after the z-origin has been found.
  - Adding of M3130, which allows to start/stop the search of the z-origin.
    - Calling of M3130 is identical to call of "Find Z=0" from the menu of the RF1000.
  - A separate G-code script has been introduced for the output of milled objects (see OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT_MILL).
  - Improved configuration, recognitation and handling of the Z-endstop(s):
    - Adding of DEFAULT_Z_ENDSTOP_TYPE, ENDSTOP_TYPE_SINGLE and ENDSTOP_TYPE_CIRCUIT - these defines can be used in order to define whether only the Z-min, only the Z-max or both Z-endstops are installed.
    - Adding of UNKNOWN_Z_ENDSTOP_DRIVE_FREE_STEPS - this define can be used in order to define how many steps the RF1000 shall try to move when both Z-endstops are installed and one of them is pressed at the moment of the start of the firmware.
      - This moving allows the RF1000 to get out of the Z-endstop even when it does not know which of them was pressed.
  - In case the currently pressed Z-endstop is unknown, a homing in Z-direction must be performed before any other movement in Z-direction is allowed.
  - The type of the installed Z-endstops also can be configured via the menu (see "Configuration" -> "General" -> "Z Type").
- For the RF2000 variant of the firmware, the following additional features have been added:
  - The pin definitions for the RF2000 board have been added.
  - Adding of support for the dual extruder.
  - Adding of support for three 24 FET outputs.
    - M3300 Pp Ss can be used in order to switch these outputs on/off.
  - Adding of support for three hardware PWM servo outputs.
    - M340 Pp Ss can be used in order to set the PWM interval.
  - Adding of support for one 230 V output.
    - M3301 Ss can be used in order to switch this output on/off.
  - Adding of support for RGB LEDs.
    - M3308 Pp can be used in order to switch the RGB mode between off, white, automatic and manual.
    - M3303 Pp Ss can be used in order to configure the RGB colors which shall be used while the RF2000 is heating up
    - M3304 Pp Ss can be used in order to configure the RGB colors which shall be used while the RF2000 is printing/milling
    - M3305 Pp Ss can be used in order to configure the RGB colors which shall be used while the RF2000 is cooling down
    - M3306 Pp Ss can be used in order to configure the RGB colors which shall be used while the RF2000 is idle
    - M3307 Pp Ss can be used in order to configure the RGB colors which shall be used for the manual RGB mode
    - In case the main screen is displayed, the leftmost hardware button can be pressed in order to toggle the RGB LEDs between the configured RGB mode and white.
  - Several texts and messages have been adapted in order to fit better to the bigger (20 columns instead of 16) display.
  - The SD card is detected automatically.
  - The always installed z-min and z-max endstops can be detected independently from each other.
- Additional minor improvements and corrections have been achieved during the review and clean-up of the firmware.

V 0.91.48 (2014-11-24)
- Adding of M3105, which allows to specify the movement after pause in [mm].
  - M3102 remains available and allows to specify the movement after pause in [steps].
- After the heat bed scan the heating bed is moved down a little bit in order to avoid accidental collisions with the extruder during the next homing.
- In case the hardware button "Pause" was pressed during the homing of the printer, the firmware could end up in a hang.
- All heaters are turned off after the heat bed scan automatically.
- In case the current movement after pause is bigger than the remaining distance in x/y/z direction, the printer moves until the min/max position.
  - Before this version, no movement into the according direction was performed in such a case.
- Cleanup of the delays for the external EEPROM.
- The calculation of the z-compensation has been moved from the previously used interrupt routine to the main loop.
- The homing-order at the beginning of the heat bed scan has been changed to the standard homing order.
- The automatic object output now can be configured via the OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT script.
  - M3104 has been removed because all of its functionality is replaced through the OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT script now.
- Adding of FEATURE_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_POSITIONS.
  - In case this #define is not 1, the "Position X/Y/Z" menu allows to move into the x/y/z direction only when the homing position is known.
- In case the "Position X/Y/Z" menu is used in order to change the position manually, the displayed position does not change anymore when the printer has reached its minimal/maximal position.
- There was a chance that the temperature management was disabled while the firmware waited for the continue/pause position. As a result, the real temperatures could go above or drop below the desired temperatures.
- There was a chance that the x/y/z steppers were moved while the "Output Filament" or "Input Filament" operations were in progress.
- Increasing of the access delay for the external EEPROM.
  - At some printers the previous delay was too short and as a result the z-compensation values could not be read/written properly.
- Adding of the "Load Filament" menu entry to the "Quick Settings" menu.
  - This operation can be used in order to load new filament to the extruder.
  - MOUNT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT can be used in order to define the exact command sequence for the load of the filament.
- Adding of the "Unload Filament" menu entry to the "Quick Settings" menu.
  - This operation can be used in order to output the filament from the extruder.
  - UNMOUNT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT can be used in order to define the exact command sequence for the unload of the filament.
- Fine tuning of various settings within Configuration.h:
  - new PID values for the extruder
  - new motor currents
  - correction of a DRV8711 register for better support of higher feedrates
  - ...
- Adding of RF1000_MICRO_STEPS which allows to switch the to-be-used micro steps between 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64.
  - The default value has been set to 32. This is different to the 8 micro steps which were used so far.
  - Most position variables have been changed from short to long in order to support also the higher number of steps.
- The format of the compensation matrix has been changed so that the same compensation matrix can be used for different micro step settings.
  - There is no need anymore to perform a rescan after the to-be-used micro steps have been changed.
- In case the z-stepper was enabled via the hardware buttons it might not have been disabled ever.
- Redefinition of the hardware buttons for the z-direction:
  - In case printing is in progress, these hardware buttons can be used in order to fine-tune the z-position. There is no automatic increasing of the z-speed in case of this mode.
  - In case there is no printing in progress, these hardware buttons behave like the "Position Z" menu.
  - FEATURE_ENABLE_MANUAL_Z_SAFETY has been enabled in order to avoid an accidental overrun of the z-min endstop.
- There was a chance that not all steppers were disabled properly during the restart/reset of the firmware.
- The case lights were not turned on/off when they were switched via the menu.
  - Removing of ENABLE_OUT1 (this pin is used for the case lights).
- Adding of support for the case fan.
  - The case fan is enabled automatically when the extruder heater is on.
  - Removing of ENABLE_HZ2 (this pin is used for the case fan now).
  - CASE_FAN_ON_TEMPERATURE can be used in order to configure the temperature at which the case fan shall be turned on.
  - CASE_FAN_OFF_DELAY can be used in order to configure the delay after which the case fan shall be turned off.
- Adding of M3120, which allows to turn the case fan on.
- Adding of M3121, which allows to turn the case fan off.
  - In case the S parameter is passed it is used in order to configure the new delay after which the case fan shall be turned off.
- When the SD card is unmounted, the menu item selector is set correctly in front of the "Mount Card" menu item.
- Avoiding of a value overflow which could cause a printing error around a z-height of 51 mm.
- Improvements for the EEPROM_MODE.
- Review of menu texts.

V 0.91.34 (2014-06-06)
- Enabling of the EEPROM_MODE.
- Review of menu texts.
- Disabling of the "Debugging" menu.
  - SHOW_DEBUGGING_MENU can be used in order to toggle this menu between "shown" and "hidden".
- Disabling of the "Configuration" -> "Extruder" menu.
  - SHOW_EXTRUDER_MENU can be used in order to toggle this menu between "shown" and "hidden".
- Increasing of the motor driver currents.
- Switching from UI_MENU_ACTIONCOMMAND_FILTER to UI_MENU_ACTIONCOMMAND for all menu entries which used MENU_MODE_PRINTING.
- The menu entry "Configuration" -> "General" -> "Lights" can be used now in order to turn the lights (Arduino pin 25) on or off.
- Improved scrolling of long menu entries.
- Merging of the changes from the repetier firmware V 0.91.7 from 2014-03-15:
  - Adding of M99.
  - Adding of support for FEATURE_BABYSTEPPING.
    - This feature allows change the z-position via the menu.
  - Adding of support for HEATER_PWM_SPEED.
    - This feature allows to configure the update speed for the heater PWMs.
  - Adding of one retry before a SD card error is detected.
  - Adding of the menu mode MENU_MODE_PRINTING.
  - Improved delta moves.
  - Several minor clean-ups and improvements.
  - Additions for improvded debugging capabilities.
- Calling of "Stop Print" while the printing was paused could hang the firmware.
- In case the printing is aborted because of any reason, also the fan is turned off now.
- In case there is a printing from the SD card going on and a temperature sensor becomes defect, the printing is aborted.
  - This functionality can be turned on and off via the FEATURE_ABORT_PRINT_AFTER_TEMPERATURE_ERROR switch.
  - A printing via the PC is not affected by this functionality and the printer continues to run in dry mode like it did until now already.
- Adding of additional beeper outputs for various changes of the printer state:
  - start/abort/stop printing via the SD card
  - pause/continue printing
  - start/abort/stop heat bed scan
- The beeper can be turned on and off via the menu "Configuration" -> "General" -> "Beeper".
  - BEEPER_MODE from Configuration.h can be used in order to define whether the beeper shall be on or off by default.
  - The beeper mode also can be stored to/restored from the EEPROM.
- Optional emergency z-stop in order to detect a possible collision (extruder against heat bed).
  - This feature can be turned on via FEATURE_EMERGENCY_Z_STOP.
  - This feature can be configured via EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_DIGITS_MIN, EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_DIGITS_MAX, EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_INTERVAL and EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_CHECKS.
- Removing of a possible value overflow in case very big values were assigned to OUTPUT_OFFSET_Z.
- Homing of an axis always sets previousMillisCmd to the current time in order to avoid that all steppers are disabled again directly after the homing.
  - In case of an operation like "Home all" via the menu of the printer, all steppers could become disabled before this change.
  - As a result, "Output Object" could not work (because per definition, it can work only in case the steppers are enabled and there was a homing since the last enabling of the steppers).
- Improved clean-up and output of the object after a stop of the printing from the SD card.
- Moving of the z-axis via the hardware buttons supports acceleration and allows faster speeds now.
- Manual outputting of filament (via the Host software and/or via the hardware button) could cause an unwanted emergency pause.
- When the printing is paused, the extruder current is lowered now.
