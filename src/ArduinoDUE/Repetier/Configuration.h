For easy configuration, the default settings enable parameter storage in EEPROM.
This means, after the first upload many variables can only be changed using the special
M commands as described in the documentation. Changing these values in the configuration.h
file has no effect. Parameters overriden by EEPROM settings are calibration values, extruder
values except thermistor tables and some other parameter likely to change during usage
like advance steps or ops mode.
To override EEPROM settings with config settings, set EEPROM_MODE 0

/** If defined, creates a thermistor table at startup.

If you don't feel like computing the table on your own, you can use this generic method. It is
a simple approximation which may be not as accurate as a good table computed from the reference
values in the datasheet. You can increase precision if you use a temperature/resistance for
R0/T0, which is near your operating temperature. This will reduce precision for lower temperatures,
which are not really important. The resistors must fit the following schematic:
@code
VREF ---- R2 ---+--- Termistor ---+-- GND
                |                 |
                +------ R1 -------+
                |                 |
                +---- Capacitor --+
                |
                V measured
@endcode

If you don't have R1, set it to 0.
The capacitor is for reducing noise from long thermistor cable. If you don't have one, it's OK.

If you need the generic table, uncomment the following define.

Define how we measure the bed rotation.
All methods need at least 3 points to define the bed rotation correctly. The quality we get comes
from the selection of the right points and method.

BED_LEVELING_METHOD 0
This method measures at the 3 probe points and creates a plane through these points. If you have
a really planar bed this gives the optimum result. The 3 points must not be in one line and have
a long distance to increase numerical stability.

BED_LEVELING_METHOD 1
This measures a grid. Probe point 1 is the origin and points 2 and 3 span a grid. We measure
BED_LEVELING_GRID_SIZE points in each direction and compute a regression plane through all
points. This gives a good overall plane if you have small bumps measuring inaccuracies.

BED_LEVELING_METHOD 2
Bending correcting 4 point measurement. This is for cantilevered beds that have the rotation axis
not at the side but inside the bed. Here we can assume no bending on the axis and a symmetric
bending to both sides of the axis. So probe points 2 and 3 build the symmetric axis and
point 1 is mirrored to 1m across the axis. Using the symmetry we then remove the bending
from 1 and use that as plane.
