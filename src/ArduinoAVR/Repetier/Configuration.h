For easy configuration, the default settings enable parameter storage in EEPROM.
This means, after the first upload many variables can only be changed using the special
M commands as described in the documentation. Changing these values in the configuration.h
file has no effect. Parameters overriden by EEPROM settings are calibration values, extruder
values except thermistor tables and some other parameter likely to change during usage
like advance steps or ops mode.
To override EEPROM settings with config settings, set EEPROM_MODE 0

- On RAMPS we must remap Y_ENDSTOPS pins or Z_ENDSTOPZ pins or LCD_ENABLE and LCD_RS pins to another pins, and connect BT to:
  a) signals of Y_MIN, Y_MAX, then set BLUETOOTH_SERIAL to 3 (RX from BT to Y_MIN, TX from BT to Y_MAX)
  b) signals of Z_MIN, Z_MAX, then set BLUETOOTH_SERIAL to 1 (RX from BT to Z_MIN, TX from BT to Z_MAX)
  c) pin 17 and 18 of AUX4 connector, then set BLUETOOTH_SERIAL to 2 (RX from BT to AUX4 p18, TX from BT to AUX4 p17)

/** Userdefined thermistor table

There are many different thermistors, which can be combined with different resistors. This result
in unpredictable number of tables. As a resolution, the user can define one table here, that can
be used as type 5 for thermistor type in extruder/heated bed definition. Make sure, the number of entries
matches the value in NUM_TEMPS_USERTHERMISTOR0. If you span definition over multiple lines, make sure to end
each line, except the last, with a backslash. The table format is {{adc1,temp1},{adc2,temp2}...} with
increasing adc values. For more informations, read
http://hydraraptor.blogspot.com/2007/10/measuring-temperature-easy-way.html

If you have a sprinter temperature table, you have to multiply the first value with 4 and the second with 8.
This firmware works with increased precision, so the value reads go from 0 to 4095 and the temperature is
temperature*8.

If you have a PTC thermistor instead of a NTC thermistor, keep the adc values increasing and use thermistor types 50-52 instead of 5-7!

If you don't feel like computing the table on your own, you can use this generic method. It is
a simple approximation which may be not as accurate as a good table computed from the reference
values in the datasheet. You can increase precision if you use a temperature/resistance for
R0/T0, which is near your operating temperature. This will reduce precision for lower temperatures,
which are not really important. The resistors must fit the following schematic:
@code
VREF ---- R2 ---+--- Termistor ---+-- GND
                |                 |
                +------ R1 -------+

                +---- Capacitor --+
                |
                V measured
@endcode

If you don't have R1, set it to 0.
The capacitor is for reducing noise from long thermistor cable. If you don't have one, it's OK.

If you need the generic table, uncomment the following define.

/*
If the firmware is in laser mode, it can control a laser output to cut or engrave materials.
Please use this feature only if you know about safety and required protection. Lasers are
dangerous and can hurt or make you blind!!!

The default laser driver only supports laser on and off. Here you control the intensity with
your feedrate. For exchangeable diode lasers this is normally enough. If you need more control
you can set the intensity in a range 0-255 with a custom extension to the driver. See driver.h
and comments on how to extend the functions non invasive with our event system.

If you have a laser - powder system you will like your E override. If moves contain a 
increasing extruder position it will laser that move. With this trick you can
use existing FDM slicers to laser the output. Laser width is extrusion width.

Other tools may use M3 and M5 to enable/disable laser. Here G1/G2/G3 moves have laser enabled
and G0 moves have it disables.

In any case, laser only enables while moving. At the end of a move it gets
automatically disabled.

Define how we measure the bed rotation. 
All methods need at least 3 points to define the bed rotation correctly. The quality we get comes

This method measures at the 3 probe points and creates a plane through these points. If you have
a really planar bed this gives the optimum result. The 3 points must not be in one line and have
a long distance to increase numerical stability.

BED_LEVELING_METHOD 1
This measures a grid. Probe point 1 is the origin and points 2 and 3 span a grid. We measure
BED_LEVELING_GRID_SIZE points in each direction and compute a regression plane through all
points. This gives a good overall plane if you have small bumps measuring inaccuracies.

BED_LEVELING_METHOD 2
Bending correcting 4 point measurement. This is for cantilevered beds that have the rotation axis
not at the side but inside the bed. Here we can assume no bending on the axis and a symmetric
bending to both sides of the axis. So probe points 2 and 3 build the symmetric axis and
point 1 is mirrored to 1m across the axis. Using the symmetry we then remove the bending
from 1 and use that as plane.
