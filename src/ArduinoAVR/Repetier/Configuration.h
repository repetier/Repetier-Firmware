For easy configuration, the default settings enable parameter storage in EEPROM.
This means, after the first upload many variables can only be changed using the special
M commands as described in the documentation. Changing these values in the Configuration.h
file has no effect. Parameters overriden by EEPROM settings are calibartion values, extruder
values except thermistor tables and some other parameter likely to change during usage
like advance steps or OPS mode.
To override EEPROM settings with config settings, set EEPROM_MODE 0

There are many different thermistors, which can be combined with different resistors. This results

increasing adc values. For more information, read
http://hydraraptor.blogspot.com/2007/10/measuring-temperature-easy-way.html

If you have a Sprinter temperature table, you have to multiply the first value by 4 and the second by 8.
This firmware works with increased precision, so the value reads go from 0 to 4095 and the temperature is
temperature*8.

If you have a PTC thermistor instead of a NTC thermistor, keep the adc values increasing and use themistor types 50-52 instead of 5-7!

If you don't feel like computing the table on your own, you can use this generic method. It is
a simple approximation which may not be as accurate as a good table computed from the reference
values in the datasheet. You can increase precision if you use a temperature/resistance for
R0/T0, which is near your operating temperature. This will reduce precision for lower temperatures,
which are not realy important. The resistors must fit the following schematic:
@code
VREF ---- R2 ---+--- Termistor ---+-- GND
                |                 |
                +------ R1 -------+

                +---- Capacitor --+
                |
                V measured
@endcode

If you don't have R1, set it to 0.
The capacitor is for reducing noise from long thermistor cable. If you don't have one, it's OK.
