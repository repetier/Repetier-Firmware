/*
Event system in a nutshell:

All printers are different and my need additions in the one or other place.
It is not very convenient to add these code parts across the firmware. For this
reason repetier-firmware uses a simple event system that comes at no cost if
a event is not used.

- simple: Only one subscriber is possible
- cost effective: Macros work as event caller. By default all macros are empty

How to use the system:

1. In Configuration.h add
#define CUSTOM_EVENTS
2. Add a file "CustomEvents.h" which overrides all event macros you need.
   It should also include the function declarations used.
3. Add a file "CustomEventsImpl.h" which includes all function definitions.
   Also it is named .h it will be included inside a cpp file only once.
   This is to compile only when selected and still keep ArduinoIDE happy.

Each of the following events describe the parameter and when it is called.

// Gets called if a missing/shorted thermistor is detected.

// Gets called before a move is queued. Gives the ability to limit moves.
